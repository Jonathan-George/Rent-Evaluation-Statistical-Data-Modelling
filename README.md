# Rent-Evaluation-Statistical-Data-Modelling

In this project I used Linear Regression method to create and validate a statistical model for determining the rent value of properties in Manhattan.

My residual plot shows that my residuals (errors) are zero. This implies that the model's predictions are unbiased, neither systematically overestimating nor underestimating the dependent variable, showing that the model is a Good fit.

My coeffeicients show that the independent variable(building_age_yrs) has more effect on the dependent variable(rent)

While the models R2 shows that my statistical model determines the rent of appartments by 75.6%.
